Description of challenging inputs:

## Default:

604A.html

This problem has a lot of Integers (no list).
Try to match with `Integers` pattern if no pattern was found.

## Constraints:

956A.html

n, m
Create a board of size n x m

n string of length `m`

839E.html (print boards) two constraints

## Operations:

Using operations to represent things like:

given integer `n` read 2 * n integers or (n - 1) for trees

## Conditionals:

398D.html

5 2 9
1

1 3
3 4
C 3
A 2 5
O 1
D 1 3
A 1 2
A 4 2
C 2
F 4
C 2

After C 1 integer | After O 1 integeer | After A 2 integer (how to solve this?)

# Complex testcases:

533A.html

# Wrong

(almost good) 691D.html (this can be fixed with proper separators).
