# TCGen

Test cases generator generator tool. The first sentence has no typo.
Given a set of strings tries to find a pattern and create a code that produce random sample for such pattern.
It is highly focused for test cases in competitive programming problems but can be used/extended beyond this scope.


## Roadmap

+ Auto detect used separators.
+ Make Python package (Installation and usage guide)
+ Benchmark on codeforces.
+ Read description of the problem to find extra constraints on the input.
